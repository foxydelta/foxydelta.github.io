        <p>
          I'm an aspiring Computer Scientist based in the Vernon Hills, IL. With
          a B.S. degree in Computer Science & Information Systems from National
          Louis University, I am equipped with a solid foundation in
          programming, cybersecurity, and system design. I am looking to
          kickstart my career in the tech industry. I am passionate about
          creating innovative solutions that solve real-world problems and I'm
          eager to embark on new challenges in the field. In my free time, I
          like to hike, play video games, and spend time at local animal
          shelters visiting the rescue dogs. I currently work part-time as the
          IT & Systems Assistant, but I am eager to dive into systems
          development and information security.

          Throughout my academic journey, I have gained valuable experience
          working on various projects, honing my skills in software development,
          and expanding my knowledge of different programming languages and
          technologies. I have a strong aptitude for problem-solving and a
          meticulous attention to detail. Additionally, I possess excellent
          communication and teamwork skills, allowing me to collaborate
          effectively with cross-functional teams and contribute to the success
          of projects. On my campus, I founded and served as President of the
          Computer Science Club. There, I helped foster interest and
          extracurricular engagement in technology for my peers.
